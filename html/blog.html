    <h1 class="bold-text">The Mask Polution in Our Oceans by Angie Plumb</h1>
      <p>
        The Covid-19 Pandemic has been affecting the world globally since late 2019,
        but the deadly disease is not the only harm coming from this tragedy. The 
        masks that we use to keep us safe are simultaneously hurting us in the long term 
        through pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you do with your masks when you’ve used them throughout the day? Apparently, 
        many people choose to throw them into our oceans. Statistics show that 1,500, 000, 000 masks 
        have been thrown into the ocean since the pandemic started. That’s equal to about 40, 000, 000 
        pounds. As you can imagine that can cause serious damage to our oceans and ocean life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is only added to our pollution problem seeing as pollution has been an ongoing problem on 
        our Earth for years. Not to mention it’s affects on global warming.
