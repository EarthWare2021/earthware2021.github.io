    <h1 class="bold-text">The Mask Polution in Our Oceans by Angie Plumb</h1>
      <p>
        The Covid-19 Pandemic has been affecting the world globally since late 2019,
        but the deadly disease is not the only harm coming from this tragedy. The 
        masks that we use to keep us safe are simultaneously hurting us in the long term 
        through pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you do with your masks when you’ve used them throughout the day? Apparently, 
        many people choose to throw them into our oceans. Statistics show that 1,500, 000, 000 masks 
        have been thrown into the ocean since the pandemic started. That’s equal to about 40, 000, 000 
        pounds. As you can imagine that can cause serious damage to our oceans and ocean life.

        will drop it off at the address you have listed. If you have all of your
        materials, you are all set to create a mask! After completing your
        homemade mask, you may either:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>

          our program if you are interested in this option, please visit our
          donate page for the drop off details.
        </li>
        <li>Keep it and rock your new mask yourself!</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h3>Interested in volunteer credit?</h3>
      <p>
        No problem! After completing your zoom training session, we will send you
        a certificate of volunteer participation. If you need us to write a letter
        for proof, contact one of our team members, and they will be happy to
        write one.
