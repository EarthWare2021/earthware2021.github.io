    <h1 class="bold-text">The Mask Polution in Our Oceans by Angie Plumb</h1>
      <p>
        The Covid-19 Pandemic has been affecting the world globally since late 2019,
        but the deadly disease is not the only harm coming from this tragedy. The 
        masks that we use to keep us safe are simultaneously hurting us in the long term 
        through pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have completed the sign up sheet on our Volunteer page, you will
        be sent a zoom link via email. This zoom will take place during one of
        your listed available times. If you have prior experience with making
        homemade masks, the zoom training is not required, but it is an amazing
        opportunity to connect with others who are passionate about the
        environment-- just like you!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not have one of the necessary items on the sign up sheet, we
        will drop it off at the address you have listed. If you have all of your
        materials, you are all set to create a mask! After completing your
        homemade mask, you may either:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Send it back to us to sell, where all proceeds are funneled back into
          our program if you are interested in this option, please visit our
          donate page for the drop off details.
        </li>
        <li>Keep it and rock your new mask yourself!</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h3>Interested in volunteer credit?</h3>
      <p>
        No problem! After completing your zoom training session, we will send you
        a certificate of volunteer participation. If you need us to write a letter
        for proof, contact one of our team members, and they will be happy to
        write one.
